[Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org) is a sister organization of 
[Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org) designed to teach 
basic concepts, skills and tools for working more effectively with data.

We develop curricula and run workshops that are 1) domain specific; 
2) target fundamental data analysis and data management challenges; and 
3) require little or no prior programming experience.

In many domains of research the rapid generation of large amounts of 
data is fundamentally changing how research is done. The deluge of 
data presents great opportunities, but also many challenges in managing, 
analyzing and sharing data. Data Carpentry aims to teach the data skills that 
will enable researchers to be more effective and productive.
